<Purpose>
  This is the namespace layer that ensures separation of the namespaces of
  untrusted code and our code. It provides a single public function to be
  used to setup the context in which untrusted code is exec'd (that is, the
  context that is seen as the __builtins__ by the untrusted code).
  
  The general idea is that any function or object that is available between
  trusted and untrusted code gets wrapped in a function or object that does
  validation when the function or object is used. In general, if user code
  is not calling any functions improperly, neither the user code nor our
  trusted code should ever notice that the objects and functions they are
  dealing with have been wrapped by this namespace layer.
  
  All of our own api functions are wrapped in NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper
  objects whose wrapped_function() method is mapped in to the untrusted
  code's context. When called, the wrapped_function() method performs
  argument, return value, and exception validation as well as additional
  wrapping and unwrapping, as needed, that is specific to the function
  that was ultimately being called. If the return value or raised exceptions
  are not considered acceptable, a NamespaceViolationError is raised. If the
  arguments are not acceptable, a TypeError is raised.
  
  Note that callback functions that are passed from untrusted user code
  to trusted code are also wrapped (these are arguments to wrapped API
  functions, so we get to wrap them before calling the underlying function).
  The reason we wrap these is so that we can intercept calls to the callback
  functions and wrap arguments passed to them, making sure that handles
  passed as arguments to the callbacks get wrapped before user code sees them.
  
  The function and object wrappers have been defined based on the API as
  documented at https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/wiki/RepyLibrary
  
  Example of using this module (this is really the only way to use the module):
  
    import namespace  
    usercontext = {}
    namespace.wrap_and_insert_api_functions(usercontext)
    safe.safe_exec(usercode, usercontext)
  
  The above code will result in the dict usercontext being populated with keys
  that are the names of the functions available to the untrusted code (such as
  'open') and the values are the wrapped versions of the actual functions to be
  called (such as 'emulfile.emulated_open').
  
  Note that some functions wrapped by this module lose some python argument
  flexibility. Wrapped functions can generally only have keyword args in
  situations where the arguments are optional. Using keyword arguments for
  required args may not be supported, depending on the implementation of the
  specific argument check/wrapping/unwrapping helper functions for that
  particular wrapped function. If this becomes a problem, it can be dealt with
  by complicating some of the argument checking/wrapping/unwrapping code in
  this module to make the checking functions more flexible in how they take
  their arguments.
  
  Implementation details:
  
  The majority of the code in this module is made up of helper functions to do
  argument checking, etc. for specific wrapped functions.
  
  The most important parts to look at in this module for maintenance and
  auditing are the following:
  
    USERCONTEXT_WRAPPER_INFO
    
      The USERCONTEXT_WRAPPER_INFO is a dictionary that defines the API
      functions that are wrapped and inserted into the user context when
      wrap_and_insert_api_functions() is called.
    
    VIRTUAL_NAMESPACE_OBJECT_WRAPPER_INFO
    
      The above four dictionaries define the methods available on the wrapped
      objects that are returned by wrapped functions. Additionally, timerhandle
      and commhandle objects are wrapped but instances of these do not have any
      public methods and so no *_WRAPPER_INFO dictionaries are defined for them.
  
    NamespaceObjectWrapper
    NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper
  
      The above two classes are the only two types of objects that will be
      allowed in untrusted code. In fact, instances of NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper
      are never actually allowed in untrusted code. Rather, each function that
      is wrapped has a single NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper instance created
      when wrap_and_insert_api_functions() is called and what is actually made
      available to the untrusted code is the wrapped_function() method of each
      of the corresponding NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper instances.
      
    NamespaceInternalError
    
      If this error is raised anywhere (along with any other unexpected exceptions),
      it should result in termination of the running program (see the except blocks
      in NamespaceAPIFunctionWrapper.wrapped_function).
